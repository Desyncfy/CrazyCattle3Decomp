# Crazy Cattle 3D Decomp (Desync's Version)
Crazy Cattle 3D is the best game ever made and can be downloaded [here](https://4nn4t4t.itch.io/crazycattle3d).

It's a Godot game made in Godot 4.4.1, so open it with that.

Decompiled with [GDSDecomp](https://github.com/GDRETools/gdsdecomp)

## Desync's Version 
This is a version of the game I have edited to add new features.

### Features 
- Unlock all levels button
- Add a new level that was scrapped from the game (Environment.tscn)
